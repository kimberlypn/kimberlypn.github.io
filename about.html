                            <p>During my freshman year, I started a YouTube channel as a way to document my journey through college. Since then, vlogging and video editing has become a passion of mine. Life does not always go as planned, and these videos are essentially the bloopers of my life-- hence, the username kimbloop.</p>

                            <p>I am currently a third year computer science major at Northeastern University. I love exploring all the quirks that come with coding, and my goal is to find a job that will present challenges from which I can learn on a daily basis. I have lived in Boston all my life and hope to travel in the future.</p>

                            <p>I was on the executive board for the Northeastern University Vietnamese Student Association for two years: first as freshman representive and then climbing the ladder to program coordinator. I learned to effectively collaborate in a group with so many rich perspectives and to advocate for myself as well as for my community, all the while finding a home away from home.</p>
