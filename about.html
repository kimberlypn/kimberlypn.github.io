                                During my freshman year, I started a YouTube channel as a way to document my journey through college. Since then, vlogging and video editing has become a passion of mine. Although I am not sure where this channel will take me, I hope that these little glimpses into the bloopers of my life will bring happiness to people along the way.

                                I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in computer science at Northeastern University. I love exploring all the quirks that come with coding, and my goal is to find a job that will present challenges from which I can learn on a daily basis. I am primarily interested in working with technology in health care, but as CS is ever prevalent in almost anything, there are still many waters in which I wish to dip my toes.

                                I was on the executive board for the Northeastern University Vietnamese Student Association for two years: first as freshman representive and then climbing the ladder to program coordinator. I learned to effectively collaborate in a group with so many rich perspectives and to advocate for myself as well as for my community-- all the while finding a home away from home.
